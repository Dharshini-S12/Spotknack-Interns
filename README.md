# Spotknack-Interns

## Features
Hello all,
   In this repository I have created a web page with CSS Animation displaying the Interns at Spotkanck.
   Here the animation property is being focused more which allows to create dynamic and visually appealing effects on web elements and keyframes property is used to define the way how the animations works.
